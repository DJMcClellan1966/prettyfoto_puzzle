    <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>PrettyFoto Puzzles is a free puzzle game that showcases nature photography and links to PrettyFoto.com for art prints. This notice explains what data we use and your choices.</p>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>This app is operated by PrettyFoto. For questions, contact via <a href="https://www.prettyfoto.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PrettyFoto.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data we collect and why</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics (if you accept cookies):</strong> We use Google Analytics to see how many people visit, how they use the app, and to improve it. This can include general location (e.g. country), device type, and how you move through the app. We do not sell this data. You can decline analytics when the banner appears; then we do not load Analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> On your device we store your choices (e.g. sound on/off, puzzle stats, whether you accepted or declined analytics) so the app works and remembers your preferences. This stays on your device and is not sent to us except as part of analytics if you accepted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal basis (EU/UK)</h2>
    <p>If you are in the European Union or the UK: we use analytics only after you consent (Accept on the banner). You can withdraw consent by choosing “Decline” next time (clear site data for this site) or by disabling analytics in your browser.</p>

    <h2>How long we keep data</h2>
    <p>Analytics data is retained according to Google’s policies (see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>). Local storage stays on your device until you clear it.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>You can ask us what data we hold about you and request correction or deletion. If we only have analytics (via Google), you can also use Google’s tools and your browser settings to control or delete that. For EU/UK users, you have the right to complain to your data protection authority.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this notice occasionally. The “Last updated” date at the top will change. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated notice.</p>
